Display Google Document Data on Website

write me a website that will display results from a google document


I'd be happy to help you create a website that displays results from a Google Document. To accomplish this, we'll need to create an HTML file with some JavaScript to fetch and display the data from a Google Sheet (which is a type of Google Document).

Here's a basic implementation:


Webpage displaying Google Sheet results
Click to open website
This HTML file creates a simple webpage that fetches data from a Google Sheet and displays it in a table format. Here's how it works:

The page uses the PapaParse library (loaded from a CDN) to parse CSV data.
You need to replace 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/YOUR_SHEET_ID/pub?output=csv' with the actual URL of your published Google Sheet CSV.
The JavaScript fetches the CSV data, parses it, and then displays it in a table format.
To use this:

Create a Google Sheet with your data.
Go to File > Share > Publish to the web.
Choose "Entire Document" and "CSV" format, then click "Publish".
Copy the provided link and replace the SHEET_URL in the JavaScript code.
Save this HTML file and open it in a web browser.
Remember that for this to work, your Google Sheet must be published to the web and accessible to anyone with the link.

Would you like me to explain any part of this code in more detail?

create a website form that inserts records into a google sheet


Certainly! I'll create a website with a form that can insert records into a Google Sheet. To accomplish this, we'll use HTML for the form, JavaScript to handle the form submission, and Google Apps Script to process the form data and insert it into a Google Sheet.

Here's how we'll set it up:

Create an HTML page with a form
Use JavaScript to submit the form data
Set up a Google Apps Script to receive the data and insert it into a Google Sheet
Let's start with the HTML and JavaScript:


Webpage form to insert records into Google Sheet
Click to open website
Now, you need to set up the Google Apps Script to receive this data and insert it into a Google Sheet. Here's how to do that:

Open your Google Sheet where you want to insert the data.
Go to Tools > Script editor.
Replace any existing code with the following:

Google Apps Script to insert form data into sheet
Click to open code
Save the script (File > Save).
Deploy the script as a web app:
Click on "Deploy" > "New deployment"
Select "Web app" as the type
Set "Execute as" to your Google account
Set "Who has access" to "Anyone"
Click "Deploy"
Copy the provided Web App URL
Replace the scriptURL in the HTML file with your Web App URL.
Now, when you open the HTML file in a web browser, you should be able to submit the form, and the data will be inserted into your Google Sheet.

A few important notes:

Make sure your Google Sheet has columns for Date, Name, Email, and Message (in that order).
The Google Apps Script needs to be authorized to access and modify your Google Sheet. You'll be prompted to grant these permissions when you first run the script.
Remember to replace 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec' in the HTML file with your actual Google Apps Script Web App URL.
This setup provides a basic form that inserts records into a Google Sheet. You can modify the form fields and corresponding Google Apps Script as needed to match your specific requirements.

Would you like me to explain any part of this setup in more detail?
